### 🤷‍♂️ Why Tradel? 🤷‍♂️

It is a fact that the financial markets are facing the emergence of a new generation of investors, who had previously shown a lack of interest in the financial markets. These new investors, mostly younger, are driven by different codes, values and interests. Today, it is crypto-currencies in particular that interest these new investors. Investing in the financial markets is therefore changing at great speed and the use of online trading platforms is playing a crucial role in this stock market storm. These online investment platforms are natively digital, intuitive and offer the possibility for individuals to invest smaller sums at lower costs. These players are thus taking part in a revolution in the way they are used, attracting more and more individuals who are ready to enter a world that was previously reserved for financial professionals. However, without solid knowledge, it is difficult to be profitable on the financial markets. And unfortunately for these new investors, the process of acquiring them is long and complex. This is where Tradel comes in.

### 🙋‍♂️ What is Tradel? 🙋‍♂️

Tradel's objective is to provide those new investors who have no knowledge of the financial markets the opportunity to be profitable in this field. More formally, it will be a financial investment assistance platform for individuals over various time horizons and different asset classes such as equities, forex, cryptocurrencies, etc. In addition, to adapt to each individual's profile, different solutions will be offered, ranging from simple investment advice to fully autonomous portfolio management. But that is not all. Indeed, as trust is important to accept to entrust one's money or to follow advice, the emphasis will be put on the transparency of the proposed performances through different elements such as a virtual portfolio or the display in real time of the way the automated portfolios behave.

### 💁‍♂️ Why choose Tradel? 💁‍♂️

Currently, there are no solutions as modular as what Tradel intends to offer. Moreover, existing solutions, which are therefore very specific, are not free of flaws, such as investment advice that is often difficult to access or automated portfolios that are complex to manage due to a large number of parameters to be managed manually. Tradel solves these problems and is therefore your future financial market indispensable.
